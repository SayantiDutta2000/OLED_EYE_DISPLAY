# OLED_EYE_DISPLAY
This is an Arduino sketch to drive an SSD1306 OLED display at 128x64 pixel resolution.
The display will mimic a human eye on the screen by using I2C Communication protocol.
To display the image we need to convert the image to HEX Code using LCD Iage Converter or Image2CPP Converter.
## PIN WIRING:-
The Vin of OLED Display is connected to the 5V of ARDUINO UNO.
The ground pin of the OLED goes to the ground of the ARDUINO UNO.
OLED Serial Clock (SCL) goes to the Analog A5 pin of the Arduino UNO.
OLED Serial Data (SDA) goes to the Analog A4 pin of the Arduino UNO.
